      the blessings we have, and how to balance the crazy growth we have experienced over
      the last five years. We have, after all, grown at an average rate of 12% per year (3
      children in 5 years). From that statement it is clear we also celebrated our 5 years
      of marriage by... going to see a children's movie without the kids and spending the
      night without them. We already act like an old couple...`

      were given Aquarium passes this year and have spent several days walking around and
      seeing all the fishes, cats, and other animals, and playing in the play center there.
      The library has also been a regular weekly visit where the girls pick out about 30 books
      and come home and pretty much have read all of them by the time Dad comes home from work.
      Wheeler farm also continues to be a near weekly destination, as well as trips to Costco.
      Perhaps the biggest blessing to our family this year is having Grandma Carter watch the girls
      a few hours each week so Andrea and I can go out and do whatever. It has been great seeing
      their relationship grow with their grandparents (and uncle Jared, who lives with them for
      the time being).`

      for Brinley, and that has made long trips much more pleasant for everyone. We also went
      to Crystal Hot Springs for the first time and the girls loved it. We also went to the

      living in the house you are trying to renovate. We heard it before, and so have
      many others, but it bears repeating: do not live in the house you plan to
      fix up until after the work is done. It has been trying and mentally and
      emotionally taxing to say the least. However, the end is approaching and all
      the work is starting to really come together, making for a beautiful home

      Thankfully we have been able to enjoy the proximity of family and good friends

      Perhaps the biggest blessing of this move is the friendships we have made with
      our neighbors, something we really didn't do very well in our last area. Whitley
      especially has been blessed with having a cute little girl her age named Gigi
      to play with who lives next door. Marley even has a friend a few doors down her
      age who both her and Whitley adore being with. With families who have children
      our kids ages, and with adults in the same stages of life as we are, this move has
      been a good one for us and given us consistent support when we needed it.`

      pleasantness of the area is only just a bonus. Watching Whitley and Marley play
      together is a true joy, especially as Marley has grown in understanding and
      opinions (and quite the opinions she has). Often playtime consists of screams,
      song, dancing, more screams, and fits of giggles and laughter. The two really
      love each other and it is great seeing their friendship grow. Whitley loves to have
      a sister who she can play house with, and Marley loves to do whatever Whitley
      is doing. It will be interesting to see how they respond together with our new
      child. We hope that the fights over who sits on mommy's lap will cease when it
      becomes clear to them that neither will win out over the baby.`

      we have learned to really enjoy walks and playing at the park. The girls really
      enjoy the seesaw, the slides, and the climbing rocks at the local playground. But
      often the thing they enjoy most is watching the other kids play. Whitley has started
      to really break out of her shell this year and isn't nearly as terrified of the
      other kids, and Marley has of course followed suit. These playground outings,
      as well as trips to the library or the splash pad in summer, constitute most
      of the outdoor adventure the girls get to enjoy. We did have one camping trip
      with some friends of ours in late summer that we enjoyed and the girls loved as
      well. Next we will try hiking and see if they like that.`

      safe despite the chaos of our lives. Several times we have had narrow calls
      only to come out relatively unscathed. Perhaps the person who took the most
      bruises and tumbles this year was Marley, having gone a solid two months with
      at least one scratch or bruise on her head (and all of them were because she
      refuses to slow down when she walks - you can read more about her craziness
      by clicking on her picture above). But that sort of mentality really has summed
      up our life - we refuse to slow down until we emotionally collapse. Hopefully
      next year we will learn to pace ourselves better - and avoid the mental
      bruises like we sustained this year along the way.`

Of course Andrea suffered the cold so as to see the many wonderful things that Chicago had to offer. We then spent an extra week in Chicago visiting Marc\'s brother Paul and his wife Mandy and their family while they were still living there. We were impressed by Chicago, but decided that we probably never want to live in a big city for more than a year.'

Around September we started getting serious about moving, and in October we decided upon a place about 5 to 10 minutes from Marc\'s office. We are very excited to be moving into this place, and the fact that it needs some work is actually exciting to Marc and Andrea (more so Marc than Andrea). Shows like "Fixer Upper" and "Property Brother\'s" have given Marc the renovation itch (and Andrea will do her best to keep him from going too crazy with it).'

So, as a family, we frequently took strolls down the main street of American Fork. Our destinations usually included the library or a park where Whitley would cautiously stare at the other children in order to work up the courage to go play. We also have developed a love of cooking in our family, and Whitley and Marley are sure to be involved (Marley by screaming if she is put down, and Whitley by pulling up a chair so she can participate). Whitley has a particular love of making scrambled eggs.'

Although we look forward to moving into our new place soon, we are grateful for the time we have spent with them. Next year starts off with us moving in to our new place with all the new friends and neighbors we are going to meet.
