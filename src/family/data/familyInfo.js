    data: 'This year has been a great year for the Phillips family. It seems like just yesterday we were welcoming Whitley into our family, and this year we were blessed with the arrival of our dear Marley. Both girls are an absolute joy and brighten our lives (and each others). We look forward to seeing the two of them grow together and continue to develop a lifelong friendship with each other.'

    data: 'Several other events happened for our family during 2016, which includes Marc working a new career, Andrea transitioning from Part-time Nurse to full-time stay-at-home mom, and Whitley starting to speak. Marley of course learned to be alive, so that is pretty incredible for her. For more information on what each individual did, click on their picture above. Once you have read their bio, click on their picture again to be brought back to this page.'

    data: 'In February Marc was sent to Chicago for work and took along the whole family. For those who don\'t know, Chicago in winter can be extremely cold, and it was in this severe weather that Andrea and Whitley toured the city while Marc worked in a heated building. Of course Andrea suffered the cold so as to see the many wonderful things that Chicago had to offer. We then spent an extra week in Chicago visiting Marc\'s brother Paul and his wife Mandy and their family while they were still living there. We were impressed by Chicago, but decided that we probably never want to live in a big city for more than a year.'

    data: 'Perhaps the biggest change for our family has been the purchase of a new home in Midvale, UT. With the arrival of Marley it became apparent pretty quickly that we would want to move into a bigger home. Around September we started getting serious about moving, and in October we decided upon a place about 5 to 10 minutes from Marc\'s office. We are very excited to be moving into this place, and the fact that it needs some work is actually exciting to Marc and Andrea (more so Marc than Andrea). Shows like "Fixer Upper" and "Property Brother\'s" have given Marc the renovation itch (and Andrea will do her best to keep him from going too crazy with it).'

    data: 'As a family we continue to develop traditions and mutual interests. Recently we have taken up the ancient pasttime of walking around the neighborhood. Whitley loves to be outside more than just about anything else in life and frequently will ask "Coming" and goes and grabs her shoes to make it clear that she wants to go out. So, as a family, we frequently took strolls down the main street of American Fork. Our destinations usually included the library or a park where Whitley would cautiously stare at the other children in order to work up the courage to go play. We also have developed a love of cooking in our family, and Whitley and Marley are sure to be involved (Marley by screaming if she is put down, and Whitley by pulling up a chair so she can participate). Whitley has a particular love of making scrambled eggs.'

    data: 'With all the wonderful things that have happened this year, we know that 2017 will be even better. We have been blessed with some great friends and (as always) wonderful family members. Currently we are living in the basement of Andrea\'s parents (yes, in our twenties and living in our parent\'s basement), and it is great watching Whitley and Marley spend so much time with them and get to know them better. Although we look forward to moving into our new place soon, we are grateful for the time we have spent with them. Next year starts off with us moving in to our new place with all the new friends and neighbors we are going to meet. We look forward to all the good times, and hope to conquer all the challenges sure we are sure to face.'
