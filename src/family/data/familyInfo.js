For those who don\'t know, Chicago in winter can be extremely cold, and it was in this severe weather that Andrea and Whitley toured the city while Marc worked in a heated building. Of course Andrea suffered the cold so as to see the many wonderful things that Chicago had to offer. We then spent an extra week in Chicago visiting Marc\'s brother Paul and his wife Mandy and their family while they were still living there. We were impressed by Chicago, but decided that we probably never want to live in a big city for more than a year.'

With the arrival of Marley it became apparent pretty quickly that we would want to move into a bigger home. Around September we started getting serious about moving, and in October we decided upon a place about 5 to 10 minutes from Marc\'s office. We are very excited to be moving into this place, and the fact that it needs some work is actually exciting to Marc and Andrea (more so Marc than Andrea). Shows like "Fixer Upper" and "Property Brother\'s" have given Marc the renovation itch (and Andrea will do her best to keep him from going too crazy with it).'

Whitley loves to be outside more than just about anything else in life and frequently will ask "Coming" and goes and grabs her shoes to make it clear that she wants to go out. So, as a family, we frequently took strolls down the main street of American Fork. Our destinations usually included the library or a park where Whitley would cautiously stare at the other children in order to work up the courage to go play. We also have developed a love of cooking in our family, and Whitley and Marley are sure to be involved (Marley by screaming if she is put down, and Whitley by pulling up a chair so she can participate). Whitley has a particular love of making scrambled eggs.'

Currently we are living in the basement of Andrea\'s parents (yes, in our twenties and living in our parent\'s basement), and it is great watching Whitley and Marley spend so much time with them and get to know them better. Although we look forward to moving into our new place soon, we are grateful for the time we have spent with them. Next year starts off with us moving in to our new place with all the new friends and neighbors we are going to meet. We look forward to all the good times, and hope to conquer all the challenges sure we are sure to face.'
