His move to Instructure has been an incredible opportunity for him and has seen him transition from Software Quality Engineer to Software Engineer. After a whole year of work he has not even considered looking for a new job, and that speaks volumes about how much he enjoys it.'

Due to the high visibility and importance to the company, he has been privileged to fly out to Chicago twice for work (and for collaborating on the project with remote co-workers more closely). Instructure has many perks that have tempted Marc sorely (a temptation which he failed resisting) and has subsequently gained several pounds. Needless to say he is loving the job, the company, and his team, but now his goal for next year at work is laying off the sweets.'

As part of his responsibilities he was able to go to Havasupai, a desert oasis in Arizona. Though the hike in and out was brutal (his boots took a chunk out of his heels and he swears he almost got heat exhaustion coming out), it was one of the more incredible experiences he has ever had. For any adventurer he highly recommends the trek through the desert to the water falls there. They also recently completed a trebuchet and will be launching pumpkins several hundred feet sometime next year.'

He looks forward to spending time with his family in the coming months in moving and improving their new home. He also hopes to continue to develop his career further but still somehow manage to be a good dad and husband. Who know being an adult would be so difficult?'

Though Andrea looks forward to being able to spend more time with Marley and Whitley, it is bittersweet to put her career on hold. She already is adjusting to raising two rambunctious little children though and continues to develop new ways to find productivity and personal growth. She has taken up cross-stitching, organizing, dejunking, and reading to name a few.'

With Whitley it was a relatively smooth transition from no child to a newborn; Marley\'s arrival is a totally different story. The jump from one child to two was much more difficult (as is to be expected). But Andrea has handled it well, despite getting little sleep. For a couple of months it seemed that Andrea slept little more than a couple hours at night, leaving us to wonder how she was able to function so well at all. Luckily things have settled down some and she has gotten into a groove with the children.'

She was quite pregnant at the time so she was treated to driving one of the trucks behind the trekkers. The experience was one that taught her a great deal about the gossip and politics of the ward, something that she had been shielded from being in primary for most of the year. All in all it was a great experience and she was glad to have participated.'

Though she often is exasperated at how little she is able to get done in a day with two children to care for, she still manages to maintain a high level of order that impresses Marc (when he notices). She has also been able to finish several books this year and looks forward to finding time to grow in other areas next year.'

She really does love her sister and we love how much she cares for her.'

But now it is going outside and looking at what there is to see. She is quite the explorer and has, from time to time, found interesting things out there to put in her mouth. We are really lucky that she has not been very sick at all this year. She has also learned to love animals of all sorts, but most especially horses (which she calls "yee-haws"). She still loves music, and recently has started attempting to sing along when she recognizes a song (and frequently requests "I am a Child of God" be played, her favorite song). Her love and zeal for music and dance is delightful, and we have several times talked about encouraging it in the future (possibly putting her in dance or something next year).'

She loves to play with other kids at the park and will always jump for joy when we are near a play area. Her friend Stella and her are also developing quite the bond, often asking to play with each other several times a week. Whitley is learning to overcome her fear of strangers as well, and maybe someday she will even go up and give her uncle Dan a hug without being prompted to do so.'

We love our little Whitley and are very excited to see what the next year will bring for her.'

And what I mean by that is she definitely has her opinions and she is sticking to them. Her fiestiness is simply fun to watch (and difficult to bear at 3am), but we love her so much. We were worried about having to open our hearts to a new baby and that we would end up loving one more than the other. This simply has not been the case and we couldn\'t image life without our little Mar. She is perky, just like Whitley, but she also never sits still. Every moment you hold her it seems like she is exploring some new thing, or chewing on your hand, or crying because you aren\'t giving her the proper view of what is going on.'

Since the time she could smile she pretty much has been doing so non-stop. Her huge gummy grin can make any situation or day better. She is on the cusp of really laughing and giggling and it only adds to her beautiful charm. As she develops it is so fascinating to note just how different she is from her sister, and it is more interesting to note how those differences make the similarities stand out even more.'

We also hope to continue to teach Whitley to teach Marley. Certainly Marley has already learned from her (such as how to modulate her screams when mad, something Whitley only recently picked up). With Whitley\'s love of Marley we hope to foster some strong bonds between the two as we teach them both to grow and learn from each other.'
