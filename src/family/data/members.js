          and energy, which all serve well for the arts. She loves to color and draw and can often be found scribbling on things (like the wall).`

As part of his responsibilities he was able to go to Havasupai, a desert oasis in Arizona. Though the hike in and out was brutal (his boots took a chunk out of his heels and he swears he almost got heat exhaustion coming out), it was one of the more incredible experiences he has ever had. For any adventurer he highly recommends the trek through the desert to the water falls there. They also recently completed a trebuchet and will be launching pumpkins several hundred feet sometime next year.'

The jump from one child to two was much more difficult (as is to be expected). But Andrea has handled it well, despite getting little sleep. For a couple of months it seemed that Andrea slept little more than a couple hours at night, leaving us to wonder how she was able to function so well at all. Luckily things have settled down some and she has gotten into a groove with the children.'

We are really lucky that she has not been very sick at all this year. She has also learned to love animals of all sorts, but most especially horses (which she calls "yee-haws"). She still loves music, and recently has started attempting to sing along when she recognizes a song (and frequently requests "I am a Child of God" be played, her favorite song). Her love and zeal for music and dance is delightful, and we have several times talked about encouraging it in the future (possibly putting her in dance or something next year).'

We were worried about having to open our hearts to a new baby and that we would end up loving one more than the other. This simply has not been the case and we couldn\'t image life without our little Mar. She is perky, just like Whitley, but she also never sits still. Every moment you hold her it seems like she is exploring some new thing, or chewing on your hand, or crying because you aren\'t giving her the proper view of what is going on.'

As she develops it is so fascinating to note just how different she is from her sister, and it is more interesting to note how those differences make the similarities stand out even more.'

With Whitley\'s love of Marley we hope to foster some strong bonds between the two as we teach them both to grow and learn from each other.'
